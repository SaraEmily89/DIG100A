                <p>Upon reviewing the website sshairbeauty.com.au, I had noticed that the overall feel of the design felt dated. In an industry where business must stay relevant in order to stay competitive, I felt that this design was doing S+S a disservice.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In my review of the business, I used my previous knowledge of hairdressers and took in to consideration: the location of their stores, which are distributed outside the CBD, in suburbs with a mid-range socioeconomic demographic; their low-mid range service price points and again the low-mid range price points of the products they are selling. With this information, I summaries that their target audience, would be females, 25 - 40 years old. Not specifically aimed at mothers, partnered or single women, however their clientele would be attracted by the budget friendly offering. I believe that the current website may be turning off customers who may turn to competitors, with higher prices points, as they may see the brand as dated and out of touch - women never want to look old than their age.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Not only is the design dated, but is quite cluttered. There are 14 different links in the header alone, which can be quite overwhelming to a potential customer forming their initial view of the brand. In my redesign I wanted to cut through the clutter and really drill down on what an S+S customer would come to their website for, but also how S+S could maximise the profit. Directing the purchase a product from the website was my main call to action. If I customer can purchase on the website straight away, this reduces overheads and the possibility that they may purchase elsewhere. Taking this into consideration, I rearranged the menu options in order of importance, starting with the ‘Products’ tab. This will be the first item that most people will see, given that we all naturally read from left to right. However, as we have been programmed to expect the checkout options on the top right hand corner, I put the ‘Cart’ tab on the right, followed by the option to book in a service in-store.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  When looking at the colour scheme of the design, I wanted to still keep theme with the purple selected in their logo and used in their in-store merchandising. However, the deep purple can be very heavy on the eye, and this specific tone dated the brand when used to excess. My main goal of the new colour scheme was to modernise, but also project a calm & soothing palette to connect with the association of pampering that female hairdressing in particular is centred around. Mostly using a greyish lavender, surrounded my pops of a brighter violet and elements that draw back to the deep logo purple, I believe the colour palette is more appealing to the customer.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The hierarchy of information was also a very important part of the design. The sliding hero image gallery does take up a large potion of the realestate, but in doing so serves multiple purposes. It give the business an opportunity to promote the work they do through beautiful imagery, and this beautiful imagery also aids in the feeling, or association a customer may have with the brand. As a customer, when I see these images I immediately want to look that good, I picture how a simple change in hair colour can make me feel like a whole new person. Now, this may not be entirely true, but the story that is being told in these images makes the customer believe, which then puts them in a mind set to spend money to achieve their goal.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I followed the inspirational images, by professionally taken images of the people who will ‘make your dreams come true’ and a short summary of their professional career. When looking for a hairdresser people want to be confident that they are going to get someone who wont mess up their hair, so by putting in this small bit of information it allows the customer to make a personal connection with their stylist before even meeting them.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I followed up with a small competition, this is a great way to grow a customer base. Customer can put their information in, the business will be able to see what products people are using at home and potentially tailor what they are offering on the website, but they can also use the contact details to get in touch with the customer and offer additional services, products, etc.
